However, discovering that Vice Chief Toushirou Hijikata has remained unchanged, Shinpachi and his unlikely Shinsengumi ally set out to return the city of Edo to how they remember it.\n\nWith even more dirty jokes, tongue-in-cheek parodies, and shameless references, Gintama' follows the Yorozuya team through more of their misadventures in the vibrant, alien-filled world of Edo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","https:\u002F\u002Fcdn.myanimelist.net\u002Fr\u002F50x70\u002Fimages\u002Fanime\u002F4\u002F50361.jpg?s=b3a061db8c3d42a055d58f9df1f3dac7","TV"],"uses":{"params":["id"]}}]}
